Apple III SOS harddisk booting

One of the things that has always been a little annoying is the Apple ///'s only way of booting is from the internal floppy drive.

This is an updated version of SOS that allows booting directly of Prodos Block mode cards.

Updates:
1. Modified boot rom
2. Updated boot loader
3. Updated SOS.KERNEL with the Problock3 driver replacing the disk3 driver
4. Disk3 driver updated so it can be loaded like any other driver.
